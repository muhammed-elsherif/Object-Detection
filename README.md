# Real-time-YOLO-Object-Detection-with-OpenCV
Real-time YOLO Object Detection using OpenCV, Faster R-CNN and pre-trained model. Detects and labels objects in image. 
> A simple yet powerful computer vision project.

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model and OpenCV. The code loads the YOLOv3 model, performs object detection on each frame from the image, and displays the output with bounding boxes and class labels.

- Clone the repository.
 - Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights from [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights). 
 - Run the Python script.
